# Active Context

*This document tracks the current focus, recent changes, and immediate next steps. It also captures active decisions, important patterns, and project insights.*

## Current Focus

- Initializing the Cline's Memory Bank for the `openai_responses` Elixir library project.
- Understanding the project structure, purpose, and existing functionality based on the README and file listing.

## Recent Changes

- Created the core Memory Bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`).
- Populated `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md` with initial information derived from `README.md`.

## Next Steps

- Populate `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, and `progress.md` based on the current understanding of the project.
- Review the populated Memory Bank for accuracy and completeness based on available information.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

- How to best represent the project's structure and functionality within the Memory Bank framework.
- Ensuring the initial population accurately reflects the state described in the README.

## Important Patterns & Preferences

- **Modularity:** The library seems organized into core (`OpenAI.Responses`), client (`OpenAI.Responses.Client`), and helper (`OpenAI.Responses.Helpers`) modules.
- **Dependency:** Relies heavily on the `Req` library for HTTP requests and streaming.
- **Configuration:** Offers multiple ways to configure the API key (env var, direct param, client).
- **Streaming:** Uses `Req`'s `:into` for streaming and provides helpers (`text_deltas`, `collect_stream`).
- **Input Handling:** Specific helpers for creating structured input, including image handling (`create_input_message`).

## Learnings & Insights

- The project is an Elixir client library specifically for the OpenAI Responses API.
- It prioritizes ease of use through helper functions and clear API calls.
- Streaming and structured input (especially images) are key supported features.
- Documentation includes a README, a Livebook tutorial, and generated API docs.
