# Project Progress

*This document tracks what currently works, what remains to be built, the overall status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions for the `openai_responses` Elixir library (v0.3.0).*

## Current Status

- **Initialized (as of 2025-03-30):** Memory Bank created and populated based on README.md, mix.exs, and file structure analysis.
- The library appears functional based on the README examples for version 0.3.0. Core features seem implemented.

## What Works (Based on README v0.3.0)

- **Installation:** Via `mix.exs`.
- **Configuration:** API key via env var, direct param, or client instance.
- **Basic API Calls:**
    - `OpenAI.Responses.create/2,3` (simple text, tools, options)
    - `OpenAI.Responses.get/1`
    - `OpenAI.Responses.delete/1`
    - `OpenAI.Responses.list_input_items/1`
- **Structured Input:**
    - Using `Helpers.create_input_message/2,3` for text and images (remote URLs and local files).
    - Manual construction of input list/map structure.
- **Streaming:**
    - `OpenAI.Responses.stream/2,3` returning an Enumerable stream.
    - `OpenAI.Responses.text_deltas/1` for extracting text chunks from the stream.
    - `OpenAI.Responses.collect_stream/1` for aggregating a stream into a full response object.
- **Helpers (`OpenAI.Responses.Helpers`):**
    - `output_text/1`
    - `token_usage/1`
    - `status/1`
    - `has_refusal?/1`
    - `refusal_message/1`
    - `create_input_message/2,3` (delegates image encoding)
- **Image Handling (`OpenAI.Responses.Helpers.ImageHelpers`):**
    - Automatic Base64 encoding for local image paths (inferred functionality).

## What's Left to Build

*(Based on initial analysis - requires deeper code review/testing)*
- Verify comprehensive error handling for API errors, network issues, and invalid input.
- Assess completeness of test coverage (`test/` directory exists).
- Potentially add support for newer OpenAI API features if not already covered.
- Explore advanced configuration options (e.g., custom HTTP timeouts via Req).

## Known Issues

*(None identified from initial README/file analysis. Requires testing.)*

## Decision Log

- **(Initial) 2025-03-30:** Created and populated the Cline's Memory Bank structure. Decided to base initial population on README, mix.exs, and file structure.
